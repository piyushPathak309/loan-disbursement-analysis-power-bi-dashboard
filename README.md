## The fintech company aims to analyze its loan disbursements, focusing on various aspects such as monthly disbursements, disbursements per loan officer, portfolio at risk, and filtering options based on branch_key, product, and loan_officer. The objective is to gain insights into disbursement trends, loan officer performance, and portfolio risk assessment.

# Monthly Disbursements in EUR:
Analyzing the principal_amount_eur measure, the dashboard displays monthly disbursements for the last 6 months. It offers a comprehensive view of disbursement trends over this period, aiding in understanding seasonal variations or growth patterns.


# Disbursements per Loan Officer:
Utilizing visualizations, the dashboard illustrates the count of loans disbursed per loan officer for the last month. Additionally, it presents the volume of disbursed loans (sum(principal_amount_eur)) attributed to each loan officer, enabling a comparative assessment of their performance.


# Portfolio at Risk:
A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) visualization showcases the ratio of (sum of principal_amount_outstanding_eur) with overdue days greater than 30 divided by the total sum(principal_amount_outstanding_eur). This metric provides insights into the proportion of the outstanding loan portfolio at risk due to overdue payments.
